# Introduction

This project aims to develop a multi-modal learning framework to predict the mechanical properties of vacuum carburized martensitic stainless steel. By integrating microstructure images, material composition, and process parameters, the framework leverages the Transformer architecture to capture complex relationships between input modalities and target properties.

# Features

- Multi-modal Data Integration: Combines microstructure images, material composition, and process parameters.
- Transformer-based Architecture: Utilizes self-attention mechanisms for effective feature fusion.
- End-to-End Training: Supports joint training of all modalities.
- Scalable and Modular: Easy to extend to other material systems or prediction tasks.

# Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- torchvision
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
